Hi, Iâ€™m John Feeney, a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, specializing in Controls, Robotics, and Autonomy. With a strong foundation in embedded systems, analog circuit design, and software development. My hobies include electronics projects, board games, and hiking.
## My Experience ##
Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from designing wheelie control systems for electric motorcycles as part of Virginia Tech BOLT, to developing a 3-band equalizer and Class-D amplifier as a personal project. Currently, Iâ€™m working with BOLT to design the control systems for our first-generation electric dirt bike

My experience also includes robotics software development, where I led my high school team in implementing computer vision-based localization and control algorithms for competition-winning robots. My ongoing personal projects are leaning PCB design with Altiumn and desgining a modular analog drum machine based on the Euro Rack standard. 

## Skills & Expertise ##
ðŸ”¹ Embedded Systems & Control Software
ðŸ”¹ PCB Design & Circuit Simulation (Altium, LTSpice)
ðŸ”¹ Robotics & Computer Vision (AprilTags, Holonomic Drivetrains)
ðŸ”¹ Analog & Digital Signal Processing

## Work & Achievements ##
My hands-on experience extends beyond personal projects and academics. Iâ€™ve worked as a lighting technician, where I handled networked lighting systems, and as an intern at Barbizon Lighting Company, where I assisted in technical repairs and installations. Additionally, I was honored with the Best in Course award for ECE 1004 and have been recognized on the Deanâ€™s List with Distinction.
