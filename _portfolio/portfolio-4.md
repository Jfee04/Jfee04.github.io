* Spected motor capable of pushing me (150 lb) up a ~5% grade hill
* Determeined capacity of batteries needed to run for 3 hours
* Moddled water safe enclosure to hold all parts safe from dust and water
* 3d printed case and assmbled the hardware
* Verified by going up the steepest hill near me, riding for 2.5 hours, and reaching max speed of 22 MPH
